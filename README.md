Network Layer Project - MVVM Architecture with SSL Pinning

Introduction

This project provides a robust network layer using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, with an emphasis on security through SSL Pinning. It aims to facilitate secure network communication and separation of concerns in your application.

Architecture

The project follows the MVVM architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation between the user interface (View), the business logic (ViewModel), and the data layer (Model). This separation enhances testability, maintainability, and scalability.

MVVM Components
Model: Handles the data layer, including network requests and data parsing.
View: Represents the UI components and binds to the ViewModel.
ViewModel: Manages the state and logic, interacting with the Model and updating the View.
SSL Pinning
SSL Pinning is implemented to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring the app communicates only with trusted servers.

Features

MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clean separation of concerns.
Network Layer: Handles API requests and responses efficiently.
SSL Pinning: Enhances security by verifying server certificates.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for network requests.
Dependency Injection: Simplifies testing and decouples components.
